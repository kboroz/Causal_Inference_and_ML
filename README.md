# Causal_Inference_and_ML

This repo contains the material for the “Causal Inference and Machine Learning” course offered by edu.opencampus.sh.

We aim to bridge the gap between classical causal analysis and modern machine learning approaches. The course draws primarily on two foundational references:

ML & Causal Inference short course from Stanford’s School of Business — a practical and theory-grounded introduction to modern methods in causal machine learning.

The CausalML Book — a comprehensive, open-access resource that explores both the theoretical underpinnings and real-world application of causal machine learning tools.

We emphasize understanding why things happen – not just predicting what will happen.

Application and usability are our main drivers. 

Watch the videos – explore the Python notebooks – try things out on your own data.

Get confident in identifying cause and effect.
